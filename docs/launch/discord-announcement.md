🎉 **LUMOS is now public!**

After months of development, we're excited to share LUMOS with the world.

**What is LUMOS?**
A schema language for Solana that generates Rust + TypeScript + Python + Go + Ruby from a single source file.

**Why?**
No more manually syncing types between your Anchor program and frontend. Write once, generate everywhere.

**Quick start:**
```bash
cargo install lumos-cli
lumos init my-project
lumos generate schema.lumos
```

**Links:**
📦 GitHub: <https://github.com/getlumos/lumos>
📖 Docs: <https://lumos-lang.org>
🦀 crates.io: <https://crates.io/crates/lumos-cli>

**What's included:**
✅ Multi-language code generation
✅ Full Anchor integration
✅ IDE support (VS Code, IntelliJ, Neovim, Emacs, Sublime)
✅ Schema versioning & migration tools
✅ Security analysis

We'd love your feedback! Drop questions in #support or open a GitHub issue.

Let's build! 🚀
