**Excited to announce LUMOS — the type-safe schema language for Solana development.**

After years of building on Solana, we kept hitting the same problem: maintaining identical type definitions in Rust programs and TypeScript frontends. Manual synchronization is error-prone, tedious, and a major source of production bugs.

LUMOS solves this by letting you define your data structures once in a simple schema language, then automatically generating production-ready code for:

• Rust (with full Anchor integration)
• TypeScript (with Borsh schemas)
• Python
• Go
• Ruby

**One source of truth. Zero type drift. Guaranteed serialization compatibility.**

But LUMOS isn't just a code generator. It's a complete development toolkit:

✅ Language Server (LSP) with IDE support for VS Code, IntelliJ, Neovim, Emacs, and Sublime
✅ Schema versioning and migration tools
✅ Security analysis and fuzzing support
✅ Complete Anchor program generation
✅ CI/CD integration via GitHub Action

We've shipped with 322 tests passing, published to crates.io and npm, and zero known vulnerabilities.

**For blockchain development teams:** LUMOS eliminates an entire class of bugs—type mismatches between on-chain programs and off-chain clients. If you've ever debugged a Borsh deserialization error, you know how valuable this is.

**For Solana developers:** This is the tooling the ecosystem has been missing. Write your types once, focus on building features instead of synchronizing code.

The project is open source (MIT/Apache 2.0) and ready for production use today.

I'd love to hear from teams who've experienced type synchronization pain. What patterns have you tried? What would make LUMOS more useful for your workflow?
